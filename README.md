# GTNH Mega Oil Cracker Multiple Fluids Input
As of patch 2.3.0, and possibly 2.3.2, quad input hatches are not working correctly with a Mega Oil Cracker. I wanted to share my setup to solve this problem and 
input up to 4 different types of fluids using Open Computers. If you want to input more fluids, you can edit the code and add another transposer.

You might want to edit the code, specifically, rename the fluids to appropriate names for understanding, and change the numbers corresponding to the direction (i.e south, top, bottom, east, etc)

The code transfers an appropriate amount of fluid into the input hatch every second or so, and it also alternates between fluids.

Here are some images showing how it is set up.
