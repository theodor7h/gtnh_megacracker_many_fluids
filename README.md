# GTNH Mega Oil Cracker Multiple Fluids Input
As of patch 2.3.0, and possibly 2.3.2, quad input hatches are not working correctly with a Mega Oil Cracker. I wanted to share my setup to solve this problem and 
input up to 4 different types of fluids using Open Computers. If you want to input more fluids, you can edit the code and add another transposer.

Here are some images showing how it is set up.
